# Configuration

DevTools has no global configuration file. During server startup and normal local build resolution, DevTools does not download source, follow symlinks, overwrite output without permission or hot-reload PHP.

An individual folder plugin may contain an optional `devtools.yml`.

```yaml
virions:
  - name: ExampleVirion
    version: ^1.0.0

include-paths:
  - runtime-data/schema.json
```

## `virions`

Each entry is either a plain name, meaning any valid version, or a map with exactly `name` and `version`. The supported constraints are listed below.

- `*`
- exact versions such as `1.2.3`
- caret ranges such as `^1.2.3`
- tilde ranges such as `~1.2.3`
- wildcards such as `1.*` or `1.2.*`
- comparison ranges such as `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`

Unknown keys, invalid names, empty values, unsupported expressions, duplicate copies of the selected version, and unsatisfied constraints fail with the responsible file and requirement in the message.

## `include-paths`

These are project-relative runtime files or directories to add to a PHAR. They are not needed for ordinary `src/` and `resources/`, which are included automatically.

Paths must exist inside the project. Absolute paths, parent traversal, symlinks, build-output overlap, hidden or temporary content, and non-portable Windows path names are rejected. Add only files required at runtime. Do not add `vendor/`, tests, local configuration, credentials, or caches.

Composer `extra.devtools.virions` and local `.poggit.yml` `libs` remain supported for migration. `devtools.yml` is the clearest format for new non-Composer projects.

For the bounded Composer v3 workflow, root `require` and `composer.lock` are the source of dependency selection. Do not repeat those packages in `devtools.yml`. Run the explicit [preparation step](dependencies.md), then point build and doctor at the prepared directory. Runtime server loading uses server-root `virions/`. A virion can itself declare the same `virions` list in `virion.yml` for local transitive requirements.
