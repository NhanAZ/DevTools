# DevTools

Load [Axolotl-PM](https://github.com/axolotl-pm/PocketMine-MP) plugins from folders, share development virions, and build standalone PHARs through server commands, the CLI, or GitHub Actions.

## Quick start

1. Download the DevTools PHAR from the [latest release](https://github.com/NhanAZ/DevTools/releases/latest). GitHub's "Source code" archives are for developing DevTools.
2. Stop your Axolotl-PM server and copy the PHAR to `plugins/DevTools.phar`.
3. Put your development plugin folder, containing `plugin.yml` and `src/`, directly inside `plugins/`.
4. Start the server. Confirm that DevTools reports folder loading, shared virions, and PHAR building as ready, then run `/devtools status` as an operator.
5. Run `/devtools doctor YourPlugin` and `/devtools build YourPlugin`. Test `build/YourPlugin.phar` on a clean server before deployment.

Install DevTools itself as a PHAR so its folder loader can start. Restart the server after adding or editing source plugins.

## Build a plugin on GitHub

Copy the [short build workflow](docs/github-actions.md#short-build-workflow) to `.github/workflows/build.yml`, pin its builder revision as documented, and push. Download the PHAR from the run's **Artifacts** section. A plugin without dependencies needs only `plugin.yml` and `src/`; no server checkout, project-local Composer installation, `devtools.yml`, or `virions/` is required.

## What it does

- Loads folder plugins through the server's plugin manager, which handles API compatibility, dependencies, duplicates, load order, and enable failures.
- Loads one compatible copy of each local development virion from `virions/` on the shared thread-safe class loader.
- Selects the highest semantic virion version satisfying every declared constraint and reports dependency conflicts.
- Builds a SHA-256 PHAR with declared virions rewritten into private namespaces using a PHP syntax tree.
- Offers optional PHPStan analysis in GitHub Actions against an explicitly selected server source.
- Validates PHAR entries before extraction and stages replacement with a backup of existing output.

Server startup and ordinary builds use local dependencies. DevTools does not replace Composer or provide hot reload.

## Requirements

- PHP `8.4` or newer, 64-bit, with the extensions required by the server
- Axolotl-PM with the API declared by `plugin.yml`
- `phar.readonly=0` only when building PHARs

See [runtime validation](docs/runtime-validation.md) for the tested server and PHP versions. DevTools is an independent community project.

## Minimal layout

All paths below are relative to the server directory.

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `plugins/DevTools.phar` | Installed DevTools plugin |
| `plugins/MyPlugin/plugin.yml` | Plugin manifest |
| `plugins/MyPlugin/src/` | Plugin source |
| `plugins/MyPlugin/resources/` | Optional plugin resources |
| `plugins/MyPlugin/devtools.yml` | Optional build and virion declarations |
| `virions/ExampleVirion/` | Local library with `virion.yml` and `src/` |
| `build/` | Generated PHARs |

If your plugin uses a shared library, put the package in `virions/ExampleVirion/` and declare it for both development loading and the standalone build.

```yaml
# plugins/MyPlugin/devtools.yml
virions:
  - name: ExampleVirion
    version: ^1.0.0
```

See [shared virions](docs/shared-virions.md) for package requirements and version selection. The [HelloShared and SharedGreeting example](examples/README.md) demonstrates the complete workflow.

## Build on every commit

The reusable workflow supports push and pull-request builds. Use the [step-level action](docs/github-actions.md#step-level-action) for extra setup or checkouts. PHPStan is off unless you select a level and server source. A complete example lives in `examples/.github/workflows/build.yml`.

## Build with a coding agent

Use the [coding agent guide](docs/ai-agent.md) for CLI automation or GitHub workflow setup. An [`AGENTS.md` template](examples/agent/AGENTS.md) is included in the examples ZIP.

## Commands

All commands require `devtools.command`, which operators receive by default.

```text
/devtools status
/devtools doctor [plugin]
/devtools virions
/devtools build <plugin> [--overwrite]
/devtools extract <phar> [--overwrite]
```

Migration aliases `/makeplugin` and `/extractplugin` are also available.

## Production guidance

Use folder plugins and shared virions for development. Deploy tested PHARs to production; editing source in place can leave partially changed code after a restart.
