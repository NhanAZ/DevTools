# Architecture

DevTools is one Axolotl-PM plugin and one Composer project. Its boundaries follow the three user workflows.

## Folder loading at startup

Axolotl-PM loads `DevTools.phar` at `STARTUP`. `DevTools::onLoad()` registers `FolderPluginLoader`. Axolotl-PM's plugin manager detects the new loader and re-triages the same plugin directory, so folder plugins participate in normal duplicate, API, dependency, main-class, resource, and enable-order handling. The loader excludes the matching source directory (`plugins/DevTools`) so the development checkout is not loaded a second time beside the DevTools PHAR.

The loader validates the project first, then maps either the manifest's `src-namespace-prefix` or the legacy fallback root onto `src/`. It never includes plugin source to inspect metadata.

## Shared virions at startup

Before the folder loader is registered, the composition root gathers each folder project's local virion requirements and `VirionManager` scans root `virions/`. `VirionProjectFactory` normalizes source and PHAR layouts. The manifest reader checks `name`, semantic `version`, `antigen`, and compatibility. The class scanner parses declarations without executing them.

`VirionProjectSelector` filters server-incompatible candidates and chooses the unique highest semantic version satisfying every plugin constraint. The registry records loaded, skipped, failed, and conflicting candidates. It rejects duplicate selected versions, antigen overlap, and class conflicts deterministically. Valid antigen and source paths are added to the server's shared `ThreadSafeClassLoader`. Compatible servers supply the same thread-safe object to async workers, including workers created later, so no separate per-worker SPL loader or worker-start task is needed when that capability is present.

## Standalone PHAR builds

`BuildConfigResolver` reads only local metadata. `PharBuilder` validates the project and stages selected input in `build/.devtools-stage-*`. Default project roots are explicit (`plugin.yml`, `src/`, `resources/`). Additional runtime paths and virions must be declared.

For each virion, a deterministic plugin-private namespace is derived from plugin name, virion name, and antigen. `NamespaceShader` parses every staged PHP file, resolves names, rejects unsafe dynamic references and ambiguous grouped imports, and rewrites static references. A second AST pass rejects any remaining locally available virion namespace, including undeclared dependencies. Virion code, resources and legal notices are copied into the artifact. Source is never modified.

The builder writes a temporary SHA-256 PHAR, reopens it, verifies the manifest, main class path, shaded roots, and signature, then installs it. Existing output moves to a temporary backup only when overwrite was explicit and is restored if installation fails.

The GitHub Action has a separate opt-in pre-build gate. With no `phpstan` input it performs no analysis. When enabled, `PhpStanConfigGenerator` creates an isolated configuration that analyzes only the plugin source and discovers types from an explicitly checked-out server plus declared virions. The action does not select or download a server itself. Composer plugins and scripts are disabled while installing the selected server's production dependencies.

## Extraction

`PharArchiveReader` adapts a real PHAR to the small archive boundary. `PharExtractor` preflights every entry before writing. It checks portable normalized relative path, containment, duplicate casing, file and directory prefix conflicts, symlink parents, destination type, and overwrite permission. It prepares a sibling staging directory, then swaps it into place with backup and restore. This boundary also allows malicious-path tests without relying on PHAR implementations accepting invalid member names.

## Dependency direction

Loader depends on Validation and Support. Virion depends on Support. Build depends on Validation, Virion metadata, Support and the PHP parser. Command and the composition root connect these services. Support has no dependency on a business module.

No module calls Command or the composition root. Build has no `Server` dependency.
